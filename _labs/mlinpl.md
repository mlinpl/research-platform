ML in PL Association is a non-profit organization set up by students from Poland that wanted to have a world-class machine learning conference in their country, so they decided to organize it themselves. The association consists of a group of volunteers, mostly undergrad, graduate, and PhD students, that are devoted to fostering the machine learning community in Poland and Europe and promoting a deep understanding of machine learning.

The Generative AI group focuses on building deep generative models (a combination of probabilistic modeling and deep learning) that could be used for defining generative processes, synthesizing new data, and quantifying uncertainty. The research carried out within the Generative AI group is reinforced by multiple applications in Life Sciences (biology, biochemistry), Molecular Sciences (chemistry, physics), and problems ranging from signal processing (e.g., data compression) to self-driving cars, and smart devices, and smart apps (e.g., chatbots, art generation).

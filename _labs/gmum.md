GMUM (Group of Machine Learning Research) is a group of researchers working on various aspects of machine learning, and in particular deep learning - in both fundamental and applied settings. The group is led by prof. Jacek Tabor. We are based in the [Jagiellonian University](https://www.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) in the beautiful city of Kraków, Poland.

Some of the research directions our group pursues include:
- Generative models: efficient training and sampling; inpainting; super-resolution,
- Theoretical understanding of deep learning and optimization,
- Natural language processing,
- Drug design and cheminformatics,
- Unsupervised learning and clustering,
- Computer vision and medical image analysis.

In 2023, we organized the second edition of [Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS^S)](https://mlss2023.com) with a focus on Applications in Science. We invite participants to collaborate with us on various ongoing research projects - [learn more here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQWUEWSid17ZT_H5SX0OqIWTdpRAd7fZshAepRnLCFTEtu9TTip_h5-7cZrFebj-Cn8S4r6ypJgFLKe/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.g908f862117_1_17).

We are a group of astronomers, machine learning enthusiasts, engineers, and enthusiasts, eminently human, coming from all over the world to make it happen. Our goal is to use foundation models to democratize Astronomy for everyone and expand our horizons on what's possible for the field moving forward. One of the big questions we want to answer is: can large language models come up with unique scientific insights and hypotheses?

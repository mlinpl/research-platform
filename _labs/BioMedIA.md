The Oxford Biomedical Image Analysis (BioMedIA) cluster is an academic group of faculty, postdoctoral researchers, software engineers, support staff and research students that develop medical imaging and image analysis algorithms and tools that aim to improve image-based diagnostics, therapies and monitoring technologies in hospitals and primary care, and for both western world and global health care settings. The breadth of our interests span all major clinical imaging modalities (particularly magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy imaging, histopathology), multi-modal imaging (imaging and audio, imaging and gaze tracking, imaging and electrocardiogram) and microscopy. We conduct inter-disciplinary translational research with clinical partners in Oxford and elsewhere in the UK and overseas in clinical domains of application ranging from fetal development, to oncology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, neurology and cardiovascular medicine.

The Laboratory of Computational Neuro-Oncology at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) focuses on biomedical data science for children and young adults with brain tumors. Our research group is affiliated with the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research at EPFL, the Department of Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM). We study clinical cancer genomes and develop statistical and AI approaches for rapid diagnostics that are globally accessible and transformative for patients with aggressive brain tumors. Our current research focus is centred on the following topics: (1) origin and somatic evolution of pediatric brain tumors (eg, Nature 2020a, Nature 2020b, npj Genomic Medicine 2023), (2) rapid molecular diagnostics in pediatric neuro-oncology (eg, The Lancet Oncology 2018, Journal of Clinical Oncology 2019), and (3) clinical cancer genomics in early-phase trials for patients with brain tumors (eg, Clinical Cancer Research 2022, Cancer Discovery 2023)

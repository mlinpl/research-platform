I am interested in methods that can deliver a robust decision-making capability in complex scenarios. Such methods can be applied in control to obtain broadly intelligent agents. At the core of this effort is solving credit assignment over prolonged horizons. I like to put, perhaps unorthodoxly, many problems under this umbrella. The tasks requiring extreme reasoning, like math solving, on the one side and classical continuous control in robotics, on the other side.

Neural networks achieve very good results in typical classification and clustering tasks. However, the interpretation of the obtained results is limited. In this project, we aim to focus on constructing deep models that make predictions by undertaking a sequence of decisions. 

Intuitively, we are dealing with models that build a decision tree/graph, allowing for an enhanced interpretation of the results. A model has already been implemented and detailed in the [https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13214).

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

You will simulate two-sided urban mobility market (like Uber or Lyft), where agents get rewarded for their actions. In particular drivers (or Connected Autonomous Vehicles- CAV) can reposition and wait for requests in different part of the city. They, however, need to learn when and where it is efficient to reposition. You will use [https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim) and apply decision modules to the agents.

### General must-have requirements

PyTorch or Tensorflow

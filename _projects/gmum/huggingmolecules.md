An open-source library for transformer-based molecular property prediction with a simple and unified API that provides the implementation of several state-of-the-art transformers for molecular property prediction. The library is in the development stage, and there are many interesting things to be implemented: novel transformer-based models, pre-training methods, integration with huggingface caching system, Continous Integration, and a few other things. The complexity of the tasks is diverse, ranging from "good first issue" to "game-changer", so basically, anyone can find something suitable :)

### General must-have requirements

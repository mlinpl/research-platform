Few-shot learning (FSL), also referred to as low-shot learning (LSL) in few sources, is a type of machine learning problems where the training dataset contains limited information. Few-shot learning aims for Deep learning models to predict the correct class of instances when a small amount of examples are available in the training dataset.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

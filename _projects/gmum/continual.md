In continual learning we want to understand the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting - network quickly losing performance at previously learned tasks after encountering new tasks. However, this usually concerns zero-shot forgetting -- what happens if we're allowed to quickly recall the old problem before attempting to solve it? The goal of the project is to investigate how quickly we can recall the "forgotten" knowledge and build a CL method optimized for that

### General must-have requirements

PyTorch or Jax

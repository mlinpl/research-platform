In the project, we aim to build models that allow for generating chemical molecules. Specifically, we want the generated molecules to satisfy certain conditions, such as activity, solubility, the number of rings, etc.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

The objective is to enable control over the process of generating objects in models like StyleGAN (and others). A solution has already been implemented, as detailed here: [https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20843](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20843). In addition to developing these types of models, we aim to use them for generating counterfactual examples, which facilitate the explanation of machine learning model predictions.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

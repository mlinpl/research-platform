You will apply ride-pooling algorithm which pools travellers (e.g. of Uber) into attractive groups. You will use ExMAS ([https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS)) which provides exact analytical search in the combinatorically exploding search space (e.g. for 1000 trip requests there is almost a googol number of possible 5-person groups). You will use this analytical results to train supervised machine learning and explore the ways to make the search space searchable.

### General must-have requirements

PyTorch or Tensorflow, optimization, ILP, networkX

The project aims to create a unified benchmark for multiple methods that reduce the inference time of deep learning models. We begin by focusing on early-exiting methods. You task will be to reimplement a conditional computation method from a selected published paper into our common codebase. Conditional computation methods are usually simple to implement and provide significant computational cost savings. We intend to publish the benchmark with the accompanying analysis as a paper in a rank A* conference. We have tasks appropriate for both beginners and people with experience.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in PyTorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

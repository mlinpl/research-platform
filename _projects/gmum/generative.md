We want to find a way to generate chemical molecules that is useful from the perspective of drug design process. Primarily, the new generative model should be able to follow given structural constraints and generate structural analogs, i.e. molecules similar to previously seen promising compounds.

### General must-have requirements

PyTorch and Tensorflow

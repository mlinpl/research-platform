The self-supervised learning model allows for constructing a data representation in an unsupervised manner, which can later be successfully used for classification or clustering. However, much depends on the augmentations used. If an augmentation changes the class, it becomes difficult to utilize such a representation in classification later. In this project, we aim to build a model that constructs a representation that is less sensitive to the type of augmentations used.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

Neural networks achieve very good results in popular domains such as images or texts. However, for tabular data, which does not possess a local structure, shallow methods like random forest or XGBoost often achieve better results. The goal is to develop neural network models that can be successfully applied to tabular data.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

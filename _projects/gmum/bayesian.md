Recently my academic focus is on continual learning. I am interested in Bayesian learning, optimization. Any reasonable combination (potentially with generative modelling) would be a fantastic project for me. If you don't have any particular ideas, I do have something to offer!

### General must-have requirements

Nice to have strong maths background.The student needs to know how to program in either tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

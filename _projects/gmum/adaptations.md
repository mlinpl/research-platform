You will simulate two-sided urban mobility market (like Uber or Lyft), where agents get rewarded for their actions. In particular travellers can decide among platforms (Uber or Lyft) or opt-out (use public transport) - based on prevoious experiences. They, however, need to learn which actions are otpimal for them (subjectively). You will use https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim and apply decision modules to the agents.

### General must-have requirements

PyTorch or Tensorflow

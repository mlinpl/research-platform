We are looking to extend our Continual World benchmark: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10919) in various ways, such as learning from pixels, implementing new RL algorithms, implementing new continual learning methods, exploring sparse rewards setting.

### General must-have requirements

Python, preferably TensorFlow 2

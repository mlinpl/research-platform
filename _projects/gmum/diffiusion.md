Two interesting projects:
1. Implicit representation of diffusion - the goal is to reduce the architecture so that it can operate on standard cards.
2. Diffusion on network weights.

### General must-have requirements

The student needs to know how to program in both tensorflow and pytorch (In order to undestand the present code and implement new methods).

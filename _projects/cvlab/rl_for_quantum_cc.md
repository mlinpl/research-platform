The goal of the project is to develop an automatic method for constructing quantum circuits. To execute a given program on a quantum computer, it must be expressed using a quantum circuit, i.e., a sequence of quantum gates. The project proposes a method based on the AlphaGo algorithm to develop a strategy for constructing quantum circuits.

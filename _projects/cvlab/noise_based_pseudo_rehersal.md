The goal of the project is to develop a method to mitigate the phenomenon of forgetting by utilizing various noise generation techniques. The starting point for further research will be the paper [Learning to See by Looking at Noise](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05963.pdf). The work will encompass a review of currently applied rehearsal methods and the creation and in-depth analysis of a method utilizing noise to reduce forgetting. Two key aspects of the work will be optimizing the method for the model's ultimate resistance to forgetting and the computational complexity of the proposed method.

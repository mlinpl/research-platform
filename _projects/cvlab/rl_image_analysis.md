The objective of the project is to develop a system for performing ultrasonographic examinations based on reinforcement learning and a collaborative robot arm xArm7. The solution involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks and computer vision algorithms to train the collaborative robot for automatic ultrasound examinations using an ultrasound probe. The project is being carried out in collaboration with the Sano computational medicine research institute. There is an opportunity to receive a scholarship.

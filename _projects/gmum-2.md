The "Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Analytics" project at the Advanced Machine Learning Lab aims
to revolutionize the way healthcare data is utilized for research and decision-making while ensuring patient privacy and
data security.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy a federated learning framework tailored to healthcare
institutions. Federated learning enables us to train machine learning models collaboratively across multiple
decentralized data sources, such as hospitals and clinics, without sharing raw patient data. This approach ensures that
sensitive patient information remains localized and never leaves its original source, maintaining strict privacy
standards.

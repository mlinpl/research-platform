The team research so far has concentrated mainly on classical graph processing problems such as reachability and shortest paths computation, especially in dynamic, fault-tolerant, and parallel settings that address some of the most significant challenges of today’s large networks. Lately, we have also been exploring connections between classical algorithm design and machine learning.

## PhD Candidate

You will cooperate with scientists carrying out research and development work related to issues such as: planning and theoretical analysis of graph algorithms – in particular within the upcoming project NCN (summary) implementation and experimental evaluation of graph algorithms on the modern parallel machines, other related scientific issues. Your work will be research-focused with minimal teaching responsibilities: teaching a minimum of 60 hours per year.

### Must-have requiremets

- a degree (Master's or equivalent) in computer science, information technology or a related discipline from a leading university
- solid understanding of the mathematics and IT basics in terms of: algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, discrete mathematics, probability theory and linear algebra,
- programming skills
- fluency in English

### Nice-to-have requiremets 

- experience in science work or programming contests in regard to algorithms would be nice to have.

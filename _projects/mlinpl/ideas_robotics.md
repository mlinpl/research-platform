The Independent Research Team aims to challenge the current approach that avoids contacts and intend robots to leverage contacts for perception and action. Focuses on using vision and tactile sensing to provide robots with detailed understanding of the environment's physics. We focus on the scientific development of our employees and the practical application of research results.

### General must-have requirements

If you are a student or graduate of Mathematics, Computer Science, Information and Communication Technology or a related discipline and would like to pursue a career in research, then share your plans with us by applying for this position.

## PhD Candidate

You will carry out research and development work related to issues such as: machine learning methods to enable robots to interact with the environment taking into account physical phenomena of this process, interactive perception, representation learning and reinforcement learning, agile robotic manipulation of deformable objects, other related scientific issues. Your work will be research-focused with minimal teaching responsibilities: teaching a minimum of 60 hours per year.

### Must-have requiremets

Educational background: MSc graduate or last year student, preferred majors: Robotics, Control, Computer Science or other science majors related to robotics and machine learning, experience in robotics and machine learning, practical experience in software development for robotic learning, including programming skills with the use of such libraries as: Robot Operating System 2, Gazebo, MuJoCo,kr PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Open3D, PCL, advanced level of English, very good programming skills, proactive approach to solve problems and scientific issues, excellent analytical and critical thinking skills, ability to work in a team.

### Nice-to-have requiremets 

We would be pleased to see in your application: experience in implementing robotic solutions experience in efficient methods of machine learning, senor data processing, robot control references with min. 1 contact to person, who can recommend you.

With expertise in diverse areas such as geometric modeling, geometry processing, computational fabrication, and machine learning, we strive to create algorithmic solutions for digital content generation. Our research efforts are dedicated to revolutionizing content creation, geometry generation, realistic rendering, and physical simulations in applications ranging from computer games and movie productions to virtual reality and 3D design. As a part of our group, you will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects, publish in top-tier conferences and journals, and collaborate with a diverse team of experts. This PhD project is an exciting opportunity to delve into the promising and rapidly evolving field of differentiable neural rendering. This is a novel area at the crossroads of machine learning and computer graphics, where traditional rendering techniques meet advanced neural networks. The primary objective of this research is to develop innovative methods for differentiable neural rendering with applications in CGI for visual effects for film, TV, and advertisement productions. The project involves developing a framework where changes in the output image can be traced back to changes in input parameters, such as object shapes, light positions, or material properties. Leveraging this, the project aims to optimize these parameters to improve the quality of the rendered image.

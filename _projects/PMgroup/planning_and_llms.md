LLM models generally lack planning capabilities. There are two extremal views on the reason, one advocates that scaling, and proper datasets, could resolve the problem. The other claims that autoregressive objective cannot lead to advanced reasoning. The goal of the project is to make an initial study towards understanding the boarder-line. In the first step, we plan to evaluate how much the performance of a large model (e.g. Llama) will increase on hard planning problems like Rubic's cube [https://twitter.com/laion_ai/status/1714883417383346493](https://twitter.com/laion_ai/status/1714883417383346493).
